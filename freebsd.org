Hello,
[[^salutation]]

I'm wondering about closing some information leaks in FreeBSD jails from 
the "outside world".
[[^ ok summary -- has some keywords, use question words]]
[[^ jails means like a chroot in unix -- sandboxing]]
[[^ outside world -- english idiom]]

Not that critical (depends on the application), but a simple user, with 
restricted devfs in the jail (devfsrules_jail for example from 
                              [[^a kind of artifact or change, example

everything, but the primary IP address of the interfaces. It seems
that 
                    
alias IPs can be viewed:

addresses. This can be used for example to detect other machines on the

There are many points from this issue can be observed. Let's take a

Hmm. Why ifconfig doesn't tell me the main IP address of an interface?
BTW, this is not usage pattern, and ARP data (MAC addresses, you can do 
interesting stuff with them, for example guess what kind of operating 
system and hardware run the given IP, etc) is not either.
[[^ have fun running a POS tagger on this]]

And not showing the MAC and IP addresses for all of your users can be 
real security.

As I said there are many different cases. In the case of a CGI server, 
you must make those executables executable. And the worst part is that 
your users can modify them without too much control.

In another example, when you would like to provide "virtual machines", 
where the user can manage his jail, this "solution" is also not good.

I think it is pointless to ask why would hiding the ARP table, or the 
system's IP addresses is sane or not, when currently you can't do a 
netstat -an from inside a jail and also can't do many other things.

Oh, and you can do iostat! :)

For me this only shows the alias assigned to the jail.

Yes, this is important. Use:

netstat works, but it limits itself to the jail pretty well. In
particular 'netstat -r' and friends  don't work. The normal 'netstat -a'
only shows connections to the current jail. It does show the output from
'netstat -m' and those sort of things, but those say nothing over the
network load of the current machine.

Not sure I see how this could be used against you.

Again only statistics. Not sure how this is a problem.

Yes, there's a lot there, but a lot *is* filtered out in a jail.

My suggestion would be to file bugs one by one for each piece of
information that causes you concern along with the reasoning of why that
information is dangerous or sensitive.

The FreeBSD developers have been atentive to these things, and have
added functionality in almost each release to minimize information
available in a jail. So pointing specific issues out will probably get
good results.

Cheers,
Nate

If it's sensitive in so far as it endangers the privacy of local
non-jailed users, I think that's a bug that'd need fixing.

I'm not sure why hiding the mentioned information is bad. It only
contains machine-specific data, and at best the private information a
jailed user will be able to figure out is the machine's usage patterns
(yes, crypto folks don't like that, but c'mon...). Hiding that data
isn't real security.

Besides, the user can only gain the data if he can execute the binaries
that provide it. Why not remove, say, the geom programs (and at the same
time make it impossible to execute new programs? Eg only make the
home/tmp dirs writeable, but put those on a noexec partition). That
should make it hard enough to access geom data.

Cheers
Benjamin

Hmm, thanks, that was a new info for me.

Yes, they are not that critical.

Nothing bad, but I can imagine a situation where the operator of the 
host machine wants to hide everything about the real specifications. For 
example if the machine is overbooked and the swap is lightly or heavily 
used, etc.

>>- NFS related statistics via nfsstat

For me, they are not, just another thing, which could be guessed about 
the host and not the jail (if I am right).

>>- a lot of interesting stuff via sysctl
> Yes, there's a lot there, but a lot *is* filtered out in a jail.
Yep.

The biggest issue for me was dmesg and the ARP table. All of the others 
were there, because I wanted to know, what else could an unprivileged 
user guess about the host.

I will open a PR with the ARP table issue.

Yes, last time I checked these, the user in a jail could list all of the 
mounted file systems. Now it is less chatty. :)

One can use bmon application in jail to graph network activity in real time,
for example:

% sysctl -a | grep jail
security.jail.set_hostname_allowed: 0
security.jail.socket_unixiproute_only: 1
security.jail.sysvipc_allowed: 0
security.jail.getfsstatroot_only: 1

security.jail.chflags_allowed: 0
security.jail.jailed: 1

The original paper from phk@ and rwatson@ presenting jails let us
sound this is a very neat concept.  While I agree this is worth adding
restrictions or features where they are really needed, the jail
framework tends towards being fairly intrusive in the system.

Therefore, I think ``hacking'' the source for all the above situations
is not a good idea, although I agree there may be a need for them.

What I'm going to say is obvious for most people, but saying it may
spur on people imagination :-).  BSD solutions are known to be smart,
setting a bandage everywhere we seem to need one is not the appropriate
way to go.  For example, it has been recently dicussed that it would be
worth having virtual network stacks, in order to have the ability to
multiplex M jails over N virtual network stacks.  The developpement of
this doesn't even started on newer FreeBSD systems, but it seems
the new upcoming routing code is going to be modified to handle
multiple routing tables, in the same way as Linux does it.  Andre
Oppermann is going to publish a paper about its intention towards
FreeBSD routing code.  If you are interested in this, you may want to
have a look at this (long) subthread [1].

The problem is actually there are many ways to access kernel
informations, and this is therefore a hard task to get a common
security framework which would be simple to use for jail.

At the moment, you might want to look at the MAC framework from the
TrustedBSD project.  I've never used it but I think it may overcome
at least some of your concerns.
